In today's digital age, communication has undergone a remarkable transformation, with instant messaging platforms playing a central role in our daily lives. The exchange of messages, images, and multimedia within these platforms has become the cornerstone of our modern social and professional interactions. WhatsApp, as one of the world's most widely used messaging applications, has cemented itself as a primary medium for communication across the globe.
The pervasive use of WhatsApp and similar messaging services has resulted in a vast and diverse collection of conversations. These chat histories encapsulate not only the mundane details of our daily lives but also our most significant interactions. They offer a unique window into our behaviours, relationships, and communication patterns, and they also hold immense potential for analysis and insight.
The goal of our project, Chat Analysis, is to harness this potential by performing a comprehensive examination of WhatsApp chat data. Our project is divided into two core components: static analysis and dynamic analysis.
Static Analysis involves the in-depth examination of chat data exported from WhatsApp. This phase focuses on uncovering patterns, relationships, and insights within the text-based conversations. It includes analysing word counts, visualizing trends, determining the most active participants, and showcasing group chat dynamics. Furthermore, it provides tools to present the analysis through graphs, enabling users to understand the ebb and flow of communication in their WhatsApp chats.
Dynamic Analysis, on the other hand, takes a real-time approach by capturing screenshots from WhatsApp Web and converting the images to text. By using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, we can transform the textual content into a format that can be analysed comprehensively. This phase not only provides insight into ongoing conversations but also takes an important step towards the identification of potentially harmful content. It identifies malicious links and fake news in chat conversations, contributing to a safer online environment.
